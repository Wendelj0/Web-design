      <h2>The Proclamation</h2>
      <p><strong>The Family: A Proclamation to the World</strong>, issued by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1995, affirms the divine nature and eternal purpose of the family.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God</strong>, and the family is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children.</li>
        <li><strong>All human beings—male and female—are created in the image of God.</strong> Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.</li>
        <li>In the premortal realm, <strong>spirits lived with God</strong>. Mortal life was granted as part of His divine plan.</li>
        <li><strong>God’s commandment to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force</strong>, and sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between a man and a woman legally and lawfully wedded.</li>
        <li><strong>Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and their children</strong>. Children are a heritage of the Lord and are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony and to be reared in love and righteousness.</li>
        <li><strong>Parents are to rear their children in love and righteousness</strong>, provide for their physical and spiritual needs, and teach them to love and serve one another, keep God’s commandments, and be law-abiding citizens.</li>
        <li><strong>Fathers are to preside in love and righteousness</strong>, provide necessities of life and protection. <strong>Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children</strong>. Fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners.</li>
        <li>Disobedience to these commandments brings consequences, both personal and societal. The disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals and nations the judgments of God.</li>
        <li>The proclamation ends with a call to <strong>responsible citizens and leaders</strong> to promote measures that strengthen the family.</li>
      </ul>
